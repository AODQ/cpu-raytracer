) figure out a way to have json not crash on error, or at the least emit an
    error string before crash
) texture viewer (for editor / ui)
) use mouse wheel to control camera speed
) use glTexSubImage2D with pixel unpack buffers
) up axis must also change for environment map
) image is flipped backwards
) select region to sample
) move spdlog out from monte-toad-core
) add save image back
) button/key that stops all rendering
) fix debug lines
) don't halt thread while waiting for tasks to finish (probably means throwing
    away openmp)
) dispatcher plugin runs actual dispatches
) imgui custom text support
) imgui 4k support
) bumpmap/normal implementation
) fix acceleration structure
) allow acceleration structure to have many options etc
) remove unused variables from functions
) fix texture errors on startup
) store override imgui resolution
) texture pointers crash  on texture resize
) iterator spans out in a spiral, and first iteration it forces 1 itr
) loading scene done in other thread, UI gives feedback on current status
) save/load scenes

-- way down the line
) imgui custom icons
) gui error when a mesh has no coords but trying to assign a texture to it
) check for memory leaks
) instancing
) subdivison surfaces
